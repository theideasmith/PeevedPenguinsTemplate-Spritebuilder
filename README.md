PeevedPenguinsTemplate-Spritebuilder
====================================
###MakeGamesWithUs Project 3
- This is a template file for an angry birds clone called Peeved Penguins, where penguins are thrown at seals. The tutorials for building this game can be found (here)[https://www.makegameswith.us/curriculum/]
Some important parts of the project are joint and spring Nods, ccp(), touchLocation, nested Nodes. 

I am mapping in my head how to add a "build your own level" feature and how to implement that in a code-design perpectiveb. 
Probably just a button in the level that says build your own, that loads a build screen, saves it to a specified location, and then if you choose to load your own scene, then loads your scene, or if you click on regularSceneLoad, then it triggers the normal scene
stored somewhere as node in spriteBuilder. 
Fork this repository and add any function you like

#######A note: It is staggering how different a game can be when it has different art. Simply staggering.
